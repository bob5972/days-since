README.txt -- part of days-since

days-since is a simple program to track a series of routine tasks, and how
often they are performed, and the number of days since they were last performed.

This was intended to track things like backups or raid scrubbing that need to
be performed periodically, and knowing how long since the last time it's been
completed can be helpful.
